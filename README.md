Parallax Effort
This project demonstrates a simple parallax scrolling effect using HTML and CSS. The page alternates between two sections with different background images, simulating a transition from morning to night and back to morning, along with corresponding text headers.

Project Description
The webpage features two main sections:

A "Good Morning" section with a morning background image.
A "Good Night" section with a night background image.
The morning section uses a parallax effect where the background image remains fixed while scrolling, creating a sense of depth. Both sections include large, centered text headers with shadow effects to enhance readability and visual appeal.

Key Features
Parallax Scrolling Effect: The morning section features a parallax effect with a fixed background image.
Background Images: Each section has a full-screen background image that covers the entire viewport and resizes automatically to maintain its aspect ratio.
Styled Headers: Large, styled text headers with shadow effects to match the theme of each section.
Responsive Design: The layout is designed to be responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
HTML5 for the structure of the webpage.
CSS3 for styling, including background images, text shadows, and layout.
